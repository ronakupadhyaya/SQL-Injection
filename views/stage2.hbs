        Congrats! You've completed Stage 1.

      <p>
        Now you're ready to log in. This page sets an insecure cookie after
        a successful login. Let's try to mess with it so we can log in as
        someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a user <code>bob</code> with a very insecure password
        <code>baseball</code>
        Log in as him and see what the cookie looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then try to log in as <code>admin</code>
      </p>
      <form method="post" class="form-inline">
        Username: <input type="text" name="username">
        Password: <input type="text" name="password">
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
      </form>
      {{else}}
        <h2>Logged in as: {{user}}</h2>
        {{#if admin}}
          <h3><a href="/{{stage3}}">Go to stage 3!</a></h3>
        {{/if}}
      {{/unless}}
